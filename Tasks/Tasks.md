### Task 1
Create a button to change the color of the text to some arbitrary color.

### Tas 2
Add a selector for the user to be able to pick a country and get the time for that country

### Task 3
Add 'npm' to this file.
(Search for word 'npm' in farsi to see what it does. Then add npm to this project).
Before start working on Task 3, merge the existing pull request. Then checkout to 'main' branch on your local machine('git checkout main') (laptop) and pull the latest changes ('git pull'). Then create another brach off of 'main'. (like the on you did with task-2).
