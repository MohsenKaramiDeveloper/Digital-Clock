Create a button to change the color of the text to some arbitrary color.

### Tas 2

### Task 3
Add 'npm' to this file.
(Search for word 'npm' in farsi to see what it does. Then add npm to this project').
Before start working on Task 3, merge your pull request. Then go to 'main' branch on your local machine (laptop) and pull the latest changes. Then create another brach off of 'main'. (like the on you did with task-2).
